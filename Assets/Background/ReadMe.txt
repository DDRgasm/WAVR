Additional info:
Both versions of Poppy Shop, as well as Jazzy Shop have the reverb tail attached to their beginning for seamless looping, so I'd highly advise to fade them in.
The midpass version of Poppy Shop is the more "authentic" one, because the quality of the audio usually diminishes when it's coming from the speakers in a store.
